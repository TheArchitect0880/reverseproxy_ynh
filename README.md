> *This package allows you to install Reverse Proxy quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

This application allows to configure a HTTP(S) reverse proxy to serve another web service, as well as an (optional) static assets directory to serve directly from nginx. The application appears as a tile in the SSOWat panel, unless configured otherwise after install. The access to the application can be made public.

The supported backends are:

- plaintext HTTP to localhost (127.x.x.x)
- HTTPS to any destination
- socket file on local disk

Please be aware that SSOWat sends user credentials in plaintext to the backend, so do not use this application to reverse-proxy a service you don't trust (for example to mirror a site hosted by someone else).


**Shipped version:** 0.2~ynh1
## Disclaimers / important information

### Backend web path

The request is transmitted as-is to the backend server. This usually means that the backend service shoudl be aware of the web path used to access the service. For example, if using the application is installed to `example.com/proxy`, your backend application should produce absolute links starting with `example.com/proxy/` too.

To support relative URLs from the backend, accessing the application via `http(s)://example.com/proxy` will permanent redirect (302) to `http(s)://example.com/proxy/` (trailing slash). Otherwise, a relative link like `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` would try to load `http(s)://example.com/style.css` which would fail.

It is possible that your backend service does not support setting up a "base URL" (custom web path). In that case, you will have to install the application on a dedicated (sub)domain.

### Plaintext localhost backend

Plaintext HTTP backend is only allowed on localhost. For now, only 127.X.X.X is allowed. 10.X.X.X should also be supported.
